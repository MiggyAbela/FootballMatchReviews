Despite Chelsea having the ball in the back of the net twice at Stamford Bridge, through Reece James and Kai Havertz, we had to make do with yet another draw against Liverpool in the Premier League.

Just like our last meeting at Anfield in January, neither side was able to find a goal in 90 minutes of Premier League action, this time at Stamford Bridge, making it a fourth draw in a row overall between the two clubs in that competition.

It wasn't for lack of trying by the Blues, though, as we enjoyed comfortably the better of the game, came close on a number of occasions in the first half and even scored twice, only to see the goal ruled out by VAR both times.

A pair of last-ditch blocks by Joel Matip and Ibrahima Konate denied Joao Felix and Mateo Kovacic what looked like certain goals early on, the latter after he had rounded goalkeeper Alisson, who quickly followed that with a point-blank save from Havertz.

Reece James then smashed in a powerful low volley that gave the keeper no chance, but VAR intervened as Enzo Fernandez had been marginally offside when Joao Felix headed the initial corner towards goal and it didn't count.

That early intensity continued into the second half and Havertz was the next player left frustrated after his shot was saved by Alisson but then ricocheted into the net, only for replays to show it came off the German's arm and for the second time VAR chalked off a Chelsea goal, leaving us to settle for a draw with Reds again.
