Saturday’s late Premier League game served up a first defeat in five matches for Chelsea...

A goal in each half did the damage and moved today’s visitors to Stamford Bridge above us in the table.

In an end-to-end and action-packed first half, it was Villa who emerged with a goal, scored by Ollie Watkins after a misplaced header from Marc Cucurella. John McGinn had hit the Chelsea woodwork before then but the Blues had the vast majority of the attacks but with nothing to show from them.

Mykhailo Mudryk had the best chance but his shot was saved and Ben Chilwell had the ball in the net just before the interval but the goal was chalked off for a foul.

Chelsea hopes of a better second half were quickly dashed when John McGinn made it 2-0 to the Midlanders with a fierce drive.

There was one piece of good news from the match. N’Golo Kante came on during the second half, a hamstring injury and surgery having kept him out since the second game of the season.
