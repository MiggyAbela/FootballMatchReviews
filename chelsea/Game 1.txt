It took a stunning Wolverhampton Wanderers strike to separate the sides in a close game at Molineux, as the new Frank Lampard era at Chelsea began with a narrow defeat.

Our opponents took the lead during a first-half spell when they were briefly on top, Matheus Nunes scoring with a shot that gave Kepa simply no chance.

Unlike other Blues performances of late, our players did not go down the tunnel at half-time wondering how they had not hit the opposition net. Our one first-half shot on-target, from Joao Felix, had been comfortably saved.

Lampard rung the attacking changes during the second half as a way to goal was sought, but by the end of the game Kepa had been marginally the busier goalkeeper, although Wolves had rarely looked like adding a second goal. Wesley Fofana was a standout figure in our defending. Kalidou Koulibaly was also busy at times.

We remain in 11th place in the Premier League table.
