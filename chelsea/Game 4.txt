Chelsea had to settle for a single Premier League point against Everton at Stamford Bridge as we were harshly punished for not killing the game off, despite controlling the match and twice taking the lead, only to be pegged back on both occasions.

The game began with a first half that was big on Chelsea dominance but low on chances, with a couple of efforts from the edge of the box by Enzo Fernandez and Mateo Kovacic the closest we came to a goal before the break.

Things sparked into life after half-time, though, with the Blues soon taking a deserved lead as Joao Felix punished a weak Everton clearance by sweeping an accurate left-footed finish into the bottom corner, via the post, from the edge of the box.

With Christian Pulisic then having a goal chalked off for offside, it was starting to look comfortable until a set-piece gave the visitors a way back into the game, when Abdoulaye Doucoure flicked James Tarkowskiâ€™s header beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga at close range and technology signalled a goal despite Kai Havertz clearing off the line.

In a breathless conclusion at the Bridge, the Blues retook the lead as Reece James was brought down in the box and Havertz showed why he is our new penalty taker by slotting home comfortably from the spot.

That should have been the end of it, but we had the win snatched away in the last minute of the 90, as substitute Ellis Simms powered away from Kalidou Koulibaly and squeezed a shot under Kepa to equalise with his first goal for Everton.
