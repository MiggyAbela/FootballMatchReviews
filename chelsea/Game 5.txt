Chelsea made it back-to-back Premier League wins by coming out on top in an entertaining and at times frantic match at Leicester City, which featured three Blues goals of the highest quality and another two ruled out for narrow offside calls.

An action-packed encounter at the King Power Stadium saw play switch back and forth constantly, but it was Chelsea who held the sharper cutting edge to emerge victorious over Leicester City.

We took an early lead as Ben Chilwell silenced the home fans' boos on his return to his former club, smashing in an impressive low volley after Kalidou Koulibaly's lofted cross.

Joao Felix looked like he had made it 2-0 when he lifted a finish over the goalkeeper while latching on to a brilliant ball over the top from Kai Havertz, but it came back off the post, and the Portuguese was then denied by a tight VAR offside call, having stroked in Ruben-Loftus Cheek's pass across goal from close range.

However, following those two opportunities closely, Leicester found an equaliser, Patson Daka smashing a powerful effort from outside the box inside Kepa Arrizabalaga's near post after Joao Felix had been dispossessed in our half.

We went in at the break with the lead, though, as right on the brink of half-time Enzo Fernandez scooped an audacious pass over the Leicester defence and Havertz deftly lifted a volley over the keeper and under the crossbar.

Both teams were pushing hard for the next goal in an end-to-end second half, with Chelsea denied by another offside, this time Mykhailo Mudryk the man who thought he'd stretched our lead.

Almost immediately afterwards we did make it 3-1, Mudryk keeping Havertz's deep cross alive for Mateo Kovacic to volley in from eight yards, meaning the game was already over as a contest by the time Leicester's Wout Faes was sent off for a second booking with three minutes left.
